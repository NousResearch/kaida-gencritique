we're writing creating spells for a game. I will provide three examples, and I'd like you to write five more that could fit into the same game:

<example1>
{
    "type": "ability",
    "title": "Firebolt",
    "description": "Conjure a ball of fire and launch it at a single Target, dealing 12 Damage on hit. A Critical Hit will light the target on fire.",
}
</example1>
<example2>
{
    "type": "ability",
    "title": "Nether Swap",
    "description": "Slip through the cracks of reality, swapping places with a single Target. On High Rolls, your target is Stunned from the disorientation.",
}
</example2>
<example3>
{
    "type": "ability",
    "title": "Arcane Missiles",
    "description": "Cast a dozen bolts of pure mana towards a Target, each dealing one Damage for a total of 12.",
}
</example3>
<example4>
{
    "type": "ability",
    "title": "Entangling Roots",
    "description": "Call forth twisting vines and roots to grab onto one Target and prevent them from using their Move Action for the next two Rounds.",
}
</example4>

remember that the cards I've shown you are just examples for what we're looking for, but you should not duplicate them or follow them closely.

when making your spells, I would like you to use the following words as your thematic inspiration. these are not to be repeated or used verbatim: $WORDS

put each spell in a block like this:

```
<item1>
...
</item1>
```
